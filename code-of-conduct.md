ITK Design - Code of Conduct
==========

This is a set of rules to make sure we keep a fun, welcoming, challenging, and fair place to work. This Code of Conduct (COC) states our shared ideals with respect to conduct. Think of this as coding standards for people. It is an expression of our ideals, not a rulebook. It is a way to communicate our existing values to the entire community.

This code of conduct is inspired by that used by Drupal and Ubuntu.

1. Be considerate
----------

Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should take those consequences into account when making decisions. The websites we create have users and other contributors. Even if it's not obvious at the time, your solutions will impact the work of others. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy, documentation, and translations during a release may negatively impact others' work.

<a name="respectfull"></a>
1. Be respectful
----------

We treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a cooperation where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Everyone is expected to be respectful when dealing with other stakeholders, users, developers etc. as well as with people outside of the project.
