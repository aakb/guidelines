ITK Design - Code of Conduct
==========

This is a set of rules to make sure we keep a fun, welcoming, challenging, and fair place to work. This Code of Conduct (COC) states our shared ideals with respect to conduct. Think of this as coding standards for people. It is an expression of our ideals, not a rulebook. It is a way to communicate our existing values to the entire community.

This code of conduct is essentially identical to that used by Drupal, except that the name of the project has been changed.
