This is a project checklist, with things we should consider in all projects.

#### Favicon
This should be a minor task as long as the site/system has some kind of identity. We should consider making favicons for all devices and have an easy guide for doing so.

#### Memcached
Is it configured? Should we use it?

#### Varnish
Is it configured? Should we use it?

#### Google Analytics

#### Site Improve

#### Browser-/deviceoptimering

#### PageSpeed Tools
What does https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/ have to say about our site/system?

#### Google Webmaster Tools & sitemap
Should we use Google Webmaster Tools and setup a sitemap?

#### Backup
Is the site/system backed up?

#### Domain name / DNS
Is the domain name registreret and the DNS prepared for launch?

#### Accessibility
